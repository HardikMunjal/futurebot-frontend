# React Project Configuration Step from Scratch
### npm init  
create package.json file

### npm install react react-dom    
React is for building the React components, while React DOM is responsible for rendering React on the browser. 

### create index.html file

<div id="react-dom-container"></div>
<script src="index.jsx"></script>

### create index.jsx file

### create react component and  add it to react-dom-container div

### we will have to convert our ES6 + JSX together to a backwards-compatible version of Javascript. This is known as “transpiling”. For this purpose, we will be using Babel.

Once again, the browser does not understand the “require” import syntax.
Modularizing and Bundling code using Webpack
So we will use Webpack. Webpack is a tool that bundles Javascript modules together. Let us install Webpack for our project.

webpack.config.js

# React Project Configuration Step from npx & create-react-app
npm also includes a tool called npx, which will run executable packages.

### npx create-react-app futurebot-frontend
configure webpack, babel , local server to run react 







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
